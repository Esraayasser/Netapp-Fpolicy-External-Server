# Netapp-Fpolicy-External-Server
### This is an external server for the Netapp's Fpolicy, implemented with C++ and socket programming.
### It implements the reading and response for the handshake and file notifications.
### Make sure that the port used in the server and the netapp run on a vm are the same, put the local ip address for the VMnet2 network on you local device as the primary server IP address in the engine setup.
### Start from Source.cpp and follow the comments to get a better view on how the engine works.
